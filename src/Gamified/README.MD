This serves as a proof-of-concept (POC) to a staking pool wherein which compounding occurs on interaction with the pool, similar to how supply interest compounds on Aave. This POC could potentially lead to some interesting gamified applications, where users engage in some variation of game theory driven "staking competition".

For example, in a single user instance, userA would only need to stake 1 token to collect all the rewards. Shortly after, let's say userB comes along and stakes 2 tokens (just 1 more than A), becoming the dominant player and receiving the lion share rewards. When this grows into a multi-user setting, users will have to strategise and compete to gain the most rewards - deciding when and how much new capital to inject versus rolling rewards.

>Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully test all the contracts and edge cases as much as I would like.

# To-do:
- update testing to be more robust and better reflect compounding on user action
